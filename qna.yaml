  - question: What is OpenShift Virtualization?
    answer: |
      OpenShift Virtualiaztion is an included feature of Red Hat OpenShift that allows you to run and manage virtual
      machine workloads alongside container workloads. It is based on the upstream KubeVirt project, and makes use of
      popular open source virtualization tools like KVM, libvirt, and QEMU to enable these virtualized workloads.
      OpenShift Virtualization adds new objects into your OpenShift cluster via a certified operator, and Kubernetes
      custom resources to enable virtualization tasks.
  - question: When was OpenShift Virtualization released?
    answer: |
      OpenShift Virtualization was first released as a tech preview with OpenShift 4.4. It became generally available
      with the release of OpenShift 4.6.
  - question: What is the purpose of OpenShift Virtualization?
    answer: |
      Originally positioned as an additional tool that would assist customers on their journey to the adoption of
      cloud-native application deployments, OpenShift Virtualization would allow users to containerize the applications
      they intended to modernize, while leaving specific legacy workloads virtualized. With the release of OpenShift
      4.12, the product had matured to the point where it was determined that it could be functionally comparable to
      similar hypervisor products, and could be positioned in such a manner.
  - question: Can I connect a VM in OpenShift to multiple networks?
    answer: |
      By default virtual machines in OpenShift are attached to the OpenShift SDN (Pod Network). Users can make use of
      the NMState operator and NodeNetworkPolicies to configure OpenShift worker nodes with OVN Secondary Networks to
      make available additional VLANs or L2 Networks which can be attached to VMs. Multus can be used to attach
      multiple VLANs to virtual machines.
  - question: How is storage for VMs managed in OpenShift Virtualization?
    answer: |
      Storage in OpenShift Virtualization is very different than traditional hypervisors that create large centralized
      datastores hosting virtual machine disk images. OpenShift Virtualization relies on the CSI (container storage
      interface) paradigm like any other persistent containerized workload in OpenShift. Storage volumes are
      provisioned on a remote storage system or SDS system running on OpenShift and attached to the containers by a CSI
      provider. The only specific requirement of storage for virtualized workloads is that RWX(ReadWriteMany) volumes
      be provisioned, as it's necessary for the live migration of VMs between worker nodes in a node failure or
      maintenance scenario.
  - question: What options are available for disaster recovery on OpenShift Virtualization?
    answer: |
      Red Hat native tools like OADP (OpenShift API for Data Protection) or the Metro-DR solution provided by OpenShift
      Data Foundation (ODF) and Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management for Kubernetes (RHACM) can perform backup and
      recovery of virtual machines deployed in OpenShift Virtualization. There are also a number of certified partner
      solutions like VEEAM Kasten, Trilio for Kuberentes, and Storware Enterprise Backup & Recovery
